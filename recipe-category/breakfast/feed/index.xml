										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lindsay’s Notes</h2>
<p>A few nights ago, I made them (again), and I set the sheet pan of salmon down on the table and my whole family literally descended upon it and started grabbing at the salmon with their hands and forks as I stood by watching in half shock, half pride. It was a feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>Of course, we love salmon. It&rsquo;s a great source of nutrition and protein and, when cooked well, it gently slides apart into buttery, juicy, delightful little flakes.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you: the main event here is that mango corn salsa.</p>
<p>The salmon itself is completely SOS (taco seasoning and THAT&rsquo;S IT), which is why I think it makes sense to put all your effort and energy into the salsa. This salsa is also the thing that&rsquo;s going to keep you sitting at the table long after you&rsquo;re done eating tacos, just scooping some extra salsa bites all on its own and suddenly thinking of it as more of a salad? It can be a salad, right? I would totally eat this salsa on its own as a salad.</p>
<p>In general, I&rsquo;m a believer that&nbsp;<a href="https://pinchofyum.com/bbq-salmon-mango-salsa">salmon and mango</a>&nbsp;are a&nbsp;<a href="https://pinchofyum.com/caribbean-jerk-salmon-bowl-with-mango-salsa">match made in heaven</a>.</p>
<p>Each bite is extra crispy and unexpected from the raw sweet corn and cucumber with a little burst of juicy flavor. But it&rsquo;s also mainstream enough with the mango that my two young kids are usually happy to devour it right along with us.</p>
<p>I love a million sauces on my tacos (okay, fine, on every recipe). But with this one, all it needs is a bit of extra lime and honey to finish it off. Simple, minimal effort, max deliciousness.</p>]]></content:encoded>
